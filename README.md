# TASK 2 - UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON
## Introduction
This repository contains a data science project aimed at analyzing the unemployment rate, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. Unemployment is an important economic indicator that measures the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labor force. By studying and understanding the trends and factors affecting unemployment, we can gain valuable insights into the job market and the broader economy.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the unemployment rate during the Covid-19 pandemic. This involves several key steps:

- Data Collection: Gathering relevant unemployment data.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Preparing the data for analysis by handling missing values, 
  outliers, and ensuring consistency.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting thorough analyses to uncover patterns, trends, and 
  relationships within the data.

## Requirements
To run the notebooks and reproduce the analysis, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries:
    NumPy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn

##Installation
You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data collection involves gathering unemployment data from reliable sources. Preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing values
- Removing or correcting outliers
- Ensuring data consistency

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize and analyze the data. Key steps include:

- Visualizing unemployment trends over time
- Analyzing the impact of Covid-19 on unemployment rates
- Identifying patterns and relationships between different variables

## Visualizing Data with a Heatmap
In this project, we use a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different variables in the unemployment dataset. Heatmaps are a powerful tool for identifying patterns and relationships in data.



## Visualizing Data with Histogram and Sunburst Plot
### Histogram
Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of a dataset. They show the frequency of data points within specified ranges.



### Sunburst Plot
Sunburst plots are used to visualize hierarchical data. 



## Conclusion
This project provided a comprehensive analysis of the unemployment rate, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. By leveraging Python's powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries, I gained valuable insights into the trends and factors affecting unemployment.
